Perhaps the model's design is flawed, in the sense that it accounts for more than one Person. Would
a better design have each model be Person specific?

	Not necessarily. I think that the security issues that could arise in for a Person in the Weasley
	would best be dealt with in the Person class itself. One way to solve the problem would be creating
	a security measure, like a password or simple dialog box entry, that can be called be Persons that are
	created with a "security" boolean or something similar. This would allow for one Weasley to account
	for multiple Persons while also being more secure.
	
	I agree with the second questions about the front end. I think that any security issues that would
	arise within the Weasley would best be dealt with on the front end rather than changing the model
	entirely.
